class BaseStrategy:
    """Implements threshold-interval based flow control.

    The overall goal is to trap the flow of apps from the
    workflow, measure it and redirect it the appropriate executors for
    processing.

    This is based on the following logic:

    .. code-block:: none

        BEGIN (INTERVAL, THRESHOLD, callback) :
            start = current_time()

            while (current_time()-start < INTERVAL) :
                 count = get_events_since(start)
                 if count >= THRESHOLD :
                     break

            callback()

    This logic ensures that the callbacks are activated with a maximum delay
    of `interval` for systems with infrequent events as well as systems which would
    generate large bursts of events.

    Once a callback is triggered, the callback generally runs a strategy
    method on the sites available as well asqeuque

    TODO: When the debug logs are enabled this module emits duplicate messages.
    This issue needs more debugging. What I've learnt so far is that the duplicate
    messages are present only when the timer thread is started, so this could be
    from a duplicate logger being added by the thread.
