# UniFaaS: Programming across Distributed Cyberinfrastructure with Federated Function Serving

## What is UniFaaS?
UniFaas is a framework that adapts the convenient federated FaaS model to enable monolithic workflows to be broken into small schedulable function units that can be flexibly executed across a resilient, federated resource pool. 
You can execute the scientific workflows across distributed cyberinfrastructures with UniFaaS.
Here is the architecture of UniFaaS. See more details in our paper.

**Currently, UniFaaS is still only a prototype. We will be dedicated to bug fixes and maintenance.**
